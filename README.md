How to install it to your Oraxen or ItemsAdder
---
Oraxen and ItemsAdder have their own hide scoreboard system. But if you have problems with that you can use this.

Oraxen:
1. Simply just extract my premade texture.
2. Then upload or copy the `assets` folder to the `/plugins/Oraxen/pack` . Leaving the `pack.mcmeta` as it not required by Oraxen.
3. Run `/o rl all` in your server.
4. Now it will be reloaded and applied to players.

ItemsAdder:
1. Same as before, but the location is different.
2. Make new folder like this `/plugins/ItemsAdder/contents/HideScoreboardNumber/resourcepack`.
3. Copy `assets` folder to the following path.
4. Run `/iareload` then `/iazip` and follow the ItemsAdder tutorial for uploading pack.
